# Raspberry-Pi-Morse-Decoder---Group-Project

A group project designed for a university coursework, to implement a Morse Decoder using Raspberry Pi. It decodes Morse code into letters using a button for input and displays the letters onto a seven-segment display.

- I developed the code for detecting button presses and interpreting the Morse code signals.
